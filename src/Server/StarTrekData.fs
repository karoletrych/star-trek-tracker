The crew is still in its own uniforms, so Kirk tries to avoid the fatal fight by talking sense and denying to be Clantons, but the five o'clock showdown remains and a forcefield prevents them from leaving town. They decide to prepare tranquilizers to fight without killing, but Chekov, alas, friendly to responsive local girl Sylvia, gets shot dead by Wyatt Earp, which Spock finds out of keeping with historical records and, therefore, clear proof their outcome is not preset. Kirk mistrusts everything now. At his insistence, the tranquilizer is tested on Scott - to no effect, which Spock knows is scientifically impossible. As the forcefield corrals them to the scene of their impending deaths.

At the same time, a group of warrior aliens called the Kazon strive to gain control of the Caretaker's space station and become the most powerful force in the region.::Tony-B4","Captain Janeway is sent on her first mission as Captain off the USS Voyager, a Starfleet Intrepid-class vessel. There mission is to find out what happened to a small maquis ship on which captain Janeway's chief of security, Lieutenant Tuvok, has infiltrated. The crew begins tracking the ship by starting at their last known location and tracking their engine emissions. This leads them into a very turbulent and unpredictable area of space known as the Bad Lands. Whilst still tracking the missing maquis ship, Voyager is pulled in to an unknown anomaly which transports them to the Delta Quadrant, 75,000 light years from home on the other side of the galaxy. As if thay weren't bad enough, many crew members are seriously injured or killed during the trip including Voyager's first officer, doctor, Nurse and Chief Engineer. After stopping a potential breach of the warp core, the entire crew of the USS Voyager is transported to a large array-like device. On board, a suitable environment is created for them to wait, however being typical Starfleet officer, Captain Janeway is unable to just sit and wait. She wants to know what exactly is going on and who has brought her and her crew to the other side of the galaxy. While poking around, Lieutenant Paris and Ensign Kim discover a strange energy signature in a barn. When the rest of the crew arrive, all pretense is dropped and the crew is subjected to a DNA test and then returned to Voyager. When they are returned, they discover that one crew member, Ensign Harry Kim, is missing. They then realize that the maquis ship that they where sent to find has been transported to the Delta Quadrant as well. When they make contact, they discover that one of their crew members, Torres, is missing as well, they both agree to launch a joint rescue mission. They then transport back to the array, the last place that they where both seen. They then encounter an old man who won't give them a straight answer; the only thing that the crew members can get out of him that there \"isn't enough time left\". He then transports them back to Voyager. Once there, a crew member reports that the array is acting strangely and that it has been sending out intermittent energy pulses. The crew then track these energy pulses to a nearby star system, but there is something very peculiar about the plant that is receiving them. There are no nucleogenic particles in the atmosphere, which should make the formation of an atmosphere impossible. Captain Janeway then decides to set course for the planet, as it may hold clues to what is going on and where the missing crew members are. While this is happening, the two missing crew members, Ensign Harry Kim and Torres, both wake up to find themselves in a white room and covered in strange lumps. When Torres tries to escape she is restrained. To her credit, it takes three of the aliens to subdue her. When she regains consciousness, she and Harry are taken on a tour of where they are. They are underground! As if that weren't bad enough, Harry discovers that others who have been sent there previously with the same condition have died. He also discovers that the people the Ocampa are completely reliant on another alien life form, to whom they refer to as the Caretaker. He provided them with the city and according to an ancient text he \"opened a great whole in the ground which led to this great city\" and has taken care of them ever since.","On their first mission to find out what happened to a missing federation officer lieutenant Tuvok who was working under cover on board a rebel Maquis ship.

But he is preoccupied with his responsibility to protect the people of a nearby planet, the Ocampa. It turns out the Caretaker is dying and doesn't have time for Janeway's request. Instead, he asks her to destroy the Array after his death--otherwise the ruthless Kazon will use it against the helpless Ocampa. Captain Janeway is confronted with a serious dilemma: if she uses the Array to go home, it will mean certain death for the Ocampa.

Meanwhile Kes's reproductive cycle, called \"the elogium\", is mysteriously triggered. She is not prepared for it, as she is too young. But the elogium occurs only once in the Ocampans' short lifespans, and if she wants to have a child, it must be now.::mmfsa2002","When the ship encounters a swarm of space-dwelling lifeforms, the crew first opts to study them from a distance. But after the creatures draw Voyager into their midst, their unusual energy patterns create problems for many of the ship's systems and cause some very strange symptoms in Kes. First the Ocampan begins eating everything in sight. Later she becomes delirious, and her body goes through peculiar changes. As the crew tries to figure out a way to move away from the lifeforms without harming them, the Doctor examines Kes and discovers that they are wreaking havoc with her metabolism. They are pushing her prematurely into the \"elogium\" - the phase in which Ocampan women become fertile. The process occurs only once in an Ocampan's life, so if Kes ever wants to have a child, she must do so immediately. Janeway and Chakotay discuss the implications of having babies on board Voyager, while Kes asks Neelix to father her child. Neelix's initial hesitation causes Kes to question whether he really wants a baby. Later, Neelix consults with Tuvok about the pros and cons of parenthood. Finally, he returns to Kes and tells her he's ready, only to discover that now she is having second thoughts. Anxious to escape the swarm, the crew attempts to move away, but the swarm follows. Suddenly, an even larger version of the creatures appears and blocks Voyager's way. Bewildered at first, the crew realizes that it is a \"suitor\" for the swarm and that it thinks Voyager is a rival. Every aggressive move they make is met by a stronger countermove from the creature. Finally, Chakotay suggests the ship act submissively by \"rolling over.\" Happily, the plan works and the swarm moves away with the big creature. Later, Kes ultimately decides against having a baby, but is relieved by the Doctor's belief that her elogium may have been a false alarm brought on by the electrophoretic field created by the swarm; it could recur later. Ironically, Janeway learns that an ensign named Wildman is pregnant, so the crew will soon welcome a new arrival after all.::Anonymous"],"imdbRating":5.9,"originalAirDate":"18 Sep. 1995","imdbURL":"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708883/","plotOutline":"Voyager encounters new life forms that have a very unusual attraction to the ship.

His timeship is found in the 1960's and Voyager finds a company that has benefited from its technology exists in 1996.::laird-3","In 1967, an apparent meteor crashes in the forest near a lone camper. Flash forward to the 24th century, where Voyager is on its trek back to the Alpha Quadrant. An artificial temporal rift opens in front of them, and a Federation vessel from the 29th century emerges. The pilot, CAPT Braxton, says that Voyager somehow is responsible for a temporal disruption in his time that destroys Earth's solar system. So he begins an attack on them, hoping to change the future. In defending themselves, Voyager disables Braxton's time ship, and he is pulled back into the time rift; so too is Voyager. Braxton's vessel is flung back to 1967 and is the meteor seen at the beginning. Voyager only goes back to 1996. Once in the 20th century, Voyager detects a warp signature in the Los Angeles area, so an away team - Janeway, Chakotay, Paris, and Tuvok - goes to investigate. Unknowingly, a SETI scientist - Rain - who has been scanning for a particular radiation signature finds it emanating from Voyager and plots their orbit. Rain calls her boss - Henry Starling - who directs her to stay quiet until she has more data. She doesn't, and Starling sends his henchman to kill her. It's revealed that he was the camper that spotted Braxton's ship, and has been using its technology to make himself very rich and powerful for the past 3 decades. He also supplied the parameters for the radiation pattern that Rain found; he was hoping for a heads up in case any future vessels followed Braxton's ship to retrieve it. Janeway and Chakotay find Braxton, who is now a crazed homeless man that explains the temporal causality loop that Voyager is now involved in. Paris and Tuvok go to meet Rain, who had sent a welcome greeting to Voyager. They secretly take her data off her computer. When she realizes what they've done, Rain chases them. That's when Starling's goon catches up with her and tries to kill her with a phaser. Paris and Tuvok spirit her away to safety. Janeway determines that Braxton still has the time ship, and tries to beam it from Starling's possession. He fights back, and actually uses the transporter beam as a data link to steal data from Voyager's computers. He then finds out that Voyager's not from the 29th century as he'd surmised, but the 24th.
